Hello there,

In order to execute the website with the database. You need to have Xampp.
Then import the database i.e, fooditems.sql file into the sever using PHPMYADMIN, with the same name fooditems. 
Now, copy the the unzipped files into htdocs of Xampp and then start the apache server and sql in the xampp.
Finally, in the browser address bar enter: http://localhost/Grocery/Grocery/ to view the website.
The username and password for the Admin are 'user' and 'password' respectively.

Thank You,
Masoom Anas Khan
